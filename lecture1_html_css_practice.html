    <p>This text is an invitation to learn about one of the youngest and most exciting of the scientific
        disciplines—computer science. Almost every day our newspapers, magazines, and televisions carry reports of
        advances
        in computing, such as high-speed
        supercomputers that perform one quadrillion (1015) mathematical operations per second; networks that
        transmit
        high-definition images and movies anywhere in the world in fractions of a second; and minute computers that
        can be
        embedded into
        our books, watches, clothing, and even our bodies. The next few years will see technological breakthroughs
        that,
        until a few years ago, existed only in the minds of dreamers and science fiction writers. These are exciting
        times
        in computing,
        and our goal in this text is to provide you with an understanding of computer science and an appreciation
        for the
        diverse areas of research and study within this important field. While the average person can produce a
        reasonably
        accurate
        description of most scientific fields, even if he or she did not study the subject in school, many people do
        not
        have an intuitive understanding of the types of problems studied by computer science professionals. For
        example, you
        probably
        know that biology is the study of living organisms and that chemistry deals with the structure and
        composition of
        matter. However, you might not have the same understanding of the work that goes on in computer science. In
        fact,
        many people
        harbor one or more of the following common misconceptions about this field. MISCONCEPTION 1: Computer
        science is the
        study of computers. This apparently obvious definition is actually incorrect or, to put it more precisely,
        incomplete.
        For example, some of the earliest and most fundamental theoretical work in computer science took place from
        1920 to
        1940, years before the development of the first computer system. (This pioneering work was initially
        considered a
        branch
        of logic and applied mathematics. Computer science did not come to be recognized as a separate and
        independent field
        of scientific study until the late 1950s to early 1960s.) Even today, there are branches of computer science
        quite
        distinct
        from the study of “real” machines. In theoretical computer science, for example, researchers study the
        logical and
        mathematical properties of problems and their solutions. Frequently, these researchers investigate problems
        not with
        actual
        computers but rather with formal models of computation, which are easier to study and analyze
        mathematically. Their
        work involves pencil and paper, not circuit boards and disks.</p>
