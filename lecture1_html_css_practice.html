            <p>This text is an invitation to learn about one of the youngest and most exciting of the scientific disciplines—computer science. Almost every day our newspapers, magazines, and televisions carry reports of advances in computing, such as high-speed
                supercomputers that perform one quadrillion (1015) mathematical operations per second; networks that transmit high-definition images and movies anywhere in the world in fractions of a second; and minute computers that can be embedded into
                our books, watches, clothing, and even our bodies. The next few years will see technological breakthroughs that, until a few years ago, existed only in the minds of dreamers and science fiction writers. These are exciting times in computing,
                and our goal in this text is to provide you with an understanding of computer science and an appreciation for the diverse areas of research and study within this important field. While the average person can produce a reasonably accurate
                description of most scientific fields, even if he or she did not study the subject in school, many people do not have an intuitive understanding of the types of problems studied by computer science professionals. For example, you probably
                know that biology is the study of living organisms and that chemistry deals with the structure and composition of matter. However, you might not have the same understanding of the work that goes on in computer science. In fact, many people
                harbor one or more of the following common misconceptions about this field. MISCONCEPTION 1: Computer science is the study of computers. This apparently obvious definition is actually incorrect or, to put it more precisely, incomplete.
                For example, some of the earliest and most fundamental theoretical work in computer science took place from 1920 to 1940, years before the development of the first computer system. (This pioneering work was initially considered a branch
                of logic and applied mathematics. Computer science did not come to be recognized as a separate and independent field of scientific study until the late 1950s to early 1960s.) Even today, there are branches of computer science quite distinct
                from the study of “real” machines. In theoretical computer science, for example, researchers study the logical and mathematical properties of problems and their solutions. Frequently, these researchers investigate problems not with actual
                computers but rather with formal models of computation, which are easier to study and analyze mathematically. Their work involves pencil and paper, not circuit boards and disks.</p>
